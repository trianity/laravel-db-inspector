### Added
- Copy buttons for commonly used README commands.
- Detailed comments for all `config/laravel-db-inspector.php` configuration variables.
- Storage engine consistency check (non-InnoDB and mixed-engine detection).
- Charset and collation consistency check (utf8 vs utf8mb4 mismatch and mixed collations).
- Auto-increment risk check for near-limit and high-growth overflow scenarios.
- Index cardinality analysis to detect low-selectivity potentially useless indexes.
- Composite index recommendation check for common `user_id + status/state` filters.
- Database-level size monitoring with threshold-based alerting.
- Table storage dominance detection and unusually large table warnings.
- Primary key presence check for all tables.

### Changed
- Enhanced table size analysis to include data/index split and ratio versus full database size.
- Expanded schema metadata extraction to include engine, collation, row estimate, and auto-increment details for advanced checks.
- Enhanced data type appropriateness with column-name based heuristics (`price/amount/total`, `is_/has_`, `*_at`, `email`).
- Enhanced index cardinality analysis with status/flag standalone-index misuse warnings.
- Updated pivot table structure rule to allow timestamps (aligning with global timestamp policy).
